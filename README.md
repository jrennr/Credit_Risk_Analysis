# Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis



## Credit Risk Analysis

Overview of the Funding Prediction Risk Analysis
The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models in predicting credit risk. By using machine learning, we can identify potential loan defaulters.

## Results
Evaluation of six distinct machine learning models has yielded the following performance metrics:

* Balanced Accuracy Score: 94.5%
Precision: 89.0%
Recall: 91.0%
Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier:

* Balanced Accuracy Score: 92.3%
Precision: 87.5%
Recall: 90.2%
Logistic Regression:

* Balanced Accuracy Score: 88.8%
Precision: 85.5%
Recall: 87.0%

These performance metrics offer valuable insights into each model's strengths and weaknesses in credit risk prediction, accuracy, and precision.

## Summary

The Balanced Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest balanced accuracy score among the models. It has superior precision and recall. It is  an attractive choice for credit risk prediction.

Logistic Regression displayed competitive precision, indicating its reliability with predictions. This model may slightly compromise the recall.

The Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier exhibited the best recall. It is highly effective with predicting defaults. Its slightly lower precision suggests a liklihood of classifying more instances as positive.

Recommendation
I recommend using the Balanced Random Forest Classifier for credit risk prediction. This model excells across all performance metrics and has a balanced approach to predicting defaults wwith a high level of accuracy.
